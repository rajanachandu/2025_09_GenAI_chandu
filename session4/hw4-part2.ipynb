    "1.What is the main purpose of RAG?\n",
    "    The main purpose of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is to make AI models give more accurate, up-to-date, and reliable answers by letting them look up external information before generating a response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Normally, an AI model can only answer based on what it was trained on (its “memory”).\n",
    "    But RAG adds a retrieval step — it searches through real documents, databases, or the web before answering.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It’s not an AI model and not exactly an AI agent — it’s a technique or architecture used to make language models (like GPT, Llama, or Mistral) smarter and more accurate."

    "3.Why do we use embeddings in a RAG pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, embeddings are used to find the most relevant pieces of information from a large set of documents before giving them to the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are the bridge between your text data and the AI’s understanding of that data.\n",
    "🔍 Step-by-step Explanation\n",
    "1. Convert text into embeddings\n",
    "An embedding is a list of numbers (a vector) that represents the meaning of a piece of text.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“car” and “automobile” → very similar embeddings (close in meaning).\n",
    "“car” and “banana” → very different embeddings.\n",
    "2. Store embeddings in a vector database\n",
    "Every document or text chunk is stored with its embedding.\n",
    "So later, when you ask a question, you can search by meaning, not by exact words.\n",
    "3. Retrieve relevant info\n",
    "When the user asks a question, that question is also turned into an embedding.\n",
    "The system compares it with stored embeddings to find the closest matches (semantically similar texts).\n",
    "These matches are then sent to the LLM as context for generating the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "You store:\n",
    "“Python is a programming language.”\n",
    "“Snakes can be dangerous.”\n",
    "Then you ask:\n",
    "“Tell me about coding in Python.”\n",
    "Without embeddings → might match both because they contain the word “Python.”\n",
    "With embeddings → matches only the programming one, because the meaning is similar."

    "4.What role does a vector database like Milvus play in RAG?\n",
    "A vector database such as Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS is used to store and search embeddings efficiently.\n",
    "It’s basically the “memory” or “search engine” for your RAG system — but instead of matching keywords, it matches meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens step-by-step:\n",
    "1.Chunk and Embed Documents, You split your documents (PDFs, articles, notes) into smaller chunks.\n",
    "2.Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding (a numerical representation of meaning). Store in Vector Database (like Milvus)\n",
    "You store these embeddings in Milvus.\n",
    "3.Milvus organizes them so it can quickly find which ones are most similar to a query embedding.\n",
    "This is called vector similarity search.\n",
    "4.Query Time — Retrieve Relevant Chunks\n",
    "When a user asks a question, the system converts the question into an embedding too.\n",
    "Milvus searches for embeddings (document chunks) that are closest in meaning to that question.\n",
    "It returns those top results (e.g., top 3–5 text chunks).\n",
    "5.Augment the Prompt for the LLM\n",
    "The retrieved chunks are added to the user’s question and passed to the LLM (like Llama, Mistral, GPT).\n",
    "The LLM then generates an informed, context-rich answer.\n",
